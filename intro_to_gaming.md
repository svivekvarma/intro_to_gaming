# These frameworks tend to focus on 2D gaming experiences and the tools crafted for them.

---

# Where is the play?

---

## Tools learned will work for any quick visualization tool you want to make from scratch.

---

# Working with the Canvas

---

# Working with the Canvas
- Introduced in HTML
- Allows for in browser rendering of 2D shapes and images
- Low level graphics interface. Fast and works with pixels.
- Can be used for 3d rendering using webgl

---

# Working with the Canvas
- Just a rectangle used for graphic rendering
- Can be accessed and styled just like any other html element

---

# Notes on Scalable Vector Graphics [SVG]
- Many data visualization packages are build using SVG
- Vector based, useful for importing/exported file formats
- All objects are saved as DOM objects. 
- Easy traversal and higher level.

---

# Working with the Canvas

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="600" height="200"></canvas>
```

```javascript
<script>

    var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
    var context = canvas.getContext('2d');

</script>
```

---

# Working with the Canvas

- Contexts allow you to do simple drawing to the canvas

```javascript
<script>

    var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
    var context = canvas.getContext('2d');

    // do cool things with the context
    context.fillStyle = "green";
    context.fillRect(10,10, 100, 100);

    context.font = '40pt Calibri';
    context.fillStyle = 'blue';
    context.fillText('Hello World!', 150, 100);

</script>
```
